                            <p>Builders Club is a premium service that enhances the ROBLOX experience.</p>
                            <p>Builders Club memberships give kids the ability to create and manage multiple structures and environments (up to 10).  Builders Club members also gain the ability to earn ROBLOX currency — called "ROBUX" — which can be used to purchase premium items in the ROBLOX catalog.  These items enable much greater (i.e. much cooler!) customization of users' avatars and their interactive creations.</p>
                            <p>In addition, Builders Club members gain the ability to promote their creations in the ROBLOX catalog and sell them to other members using the virtual ROBLOX economy.</p>
                            <p>Finally, unlike free account holders, Builders Club members will no longer be exposed to, or distracted by, on screen advertisements.</p>
                            <p>For parents who are interested in learning more about subscription options or in purchasing a Builders Club membership for their child, click on the membership button on the home page or <a id="ctl00_cphRoblox_BCSignUpHyperLink" href="/Upgrades/BuildersClub.aspx">start the sign-up process</a> now.</p>

                            <p>At this time ROBLOX accepts payment via all major credit cards.  We will be expanding our selection of payment methods in the coming months.  Please do not mail cash to ROBLOX headquarters.</p>

                            <p>All transactions on ROBLOX use secure commercial-grade encryption.  Furthermore, information relating to your payment (such as your credit card number) never resides on our servers.

                            <p>Memberships will be activated as soon as payment is received.  How quickly this occurs depends upon the method of payment.</p>

                                <strong>PayPal:</strong> If your PayPal account charges directly to a credit card, your membership will usually be activated within one day.  If your PayPal account charges to a bank account (eCheck), up to 10 days may be required to receive payment.

                            <p>You do not lose anything when your membership expires.  Your account loses Builders Club status, but will remain active.  You will keep all existing places that you own and all assets (including your current ROBUX and Tickets balance).  You will lose all other abilities associated with being in Builders Club.  Accounts can be re-subscribed at any time.</p>

                            <p>Cancellations only apply to monthly Builders Club subscriptions that were paid via credit card.  Canceling is easy — simply click the <a id="ctl00_cphRoblox_HyperLink1" href="/Upgrades/Cancel.aspx">Cancel Membership</a> button that appears on the Builders Club page and confirm the cancellation.  If you cancel a recurring subscription, you will continue to receive Builders Club privileges for the remainder of the currently paid month.</p>
