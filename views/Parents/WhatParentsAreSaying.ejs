                            "Hi, I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate Roblox. My son who is 12 uses your service all the time. One of the movie competitions motivates him to sit down and learn new software to develop new movie scenes. I watched him a couple days ago, working hard on powerpoint, windows movie maker and other software, trying to make his Roblox movie. He didn't know how to use any of this software and learned it on his own through his motivation from Roblox. It's kind of neat how simple things like having a special 'hat' for his character is so gratifying to him. He joined the Roblox Builders Club a few days ago. He was willing to give up $5 a month from his allowance per month to pay for it (we are paying for it, but appreciated his devotion). Anyway, I appreciate your service and also how safe it is for kids. I am enjoying seeing him thrive from the competition and creativity you challenge your users with. Best of luck with Roblox."

Since he began he has learned much about scripting, and other computer related tasks....Your website has helped him with his self-esteem and social development as well. The whole time he has been thoroughly entertained by Roblox. His dream is to someday make video games, and i am certain that the time he spends participating in the Roblox community will help him achieve that goal."

Although I still have alot to learn, my lua scripting abilities are starting to expand into vast regions, I've never known about. It's an awesome experience that even my parents are 'jaw dropping' about! They find it amazing that I can do LUA Programming!"
